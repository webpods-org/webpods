# Hierarchical Streams Refactoring Status

## Completed Work

### 1. Path Resolution System ✅

- Created `resolvePath()` function to convert paths to stream IDs and record names
- Created `resolvePathForWrite()` for write operations
- Path resolution correctly identifies whether a path points to a stream or record

### 2. Domain Functions Updated ✅

- Created `getStreamById()` to fetch streams by numeric ID
- Created `listChildStreams()` and `countChildStreams()` for hierarchy navigation
- Created domain functions for record operations:
  - `hasTombstone()` - Check for soft-deleted records
  - `purgeRecord()` - Hard delete records
  - `deleteRecord()` - Soft delete with tombstones
- Updated `deleteStream()` to handle child streams (CASCADE deletes)
- All domain functions now use numeric stream IDs instead of string paths

### 3. Route Handlers Refactored ✅

- **GET routes**: Now use path resolution to determine stream/record
- **POST routes**: Use `resolvePathForWrite()` and create hierarchies as needed
- **DELETE routes**: Use path resolution for consistent behavior
- All SQL queries removed from route handlers - moved to domain layer
- Routes now include child streams in list responses (like `ls` showing directories)

### 4. Permissions System ✅

- Permission inheritance through parent hierarchy already implemented
- `canRead()` and `canWrite()` traverse up parent chain checking permissions

### 5. API Response Structure ✅

- List responses now include both records and child streams
- `StreamListResponse` includes `streams: StreamInfo[]` for child streams
- Recursive mode lists all descendants (like `ls -R`)

### 6. Cleanup ✅

- Removed old monolithic `routes/pods.ts` file
- Removed unnecessary backward compatibility wrapper `get-stream.ts`
- No legacy code or compatibility layers remain

## Architecture Summary

The system now works like a filesystem:

- **Streams** = Directories (can have parent/child relationships)
- **Records** = Files (belong to a stream, have unique names within stream)
- **Paths** = Hierarchical paths like `/blog/posts/2024`

Key design decisions:

- Stream names and record names cannot contain slashes
- Hierarchy is managed through `parent_id` relationships
- All operations use numeric IDs after path resolution
- PostgreSQL CASCADE handles deletion of child streams

## Remaining Work

### Tests Need Updates

- Integration tests still expect flat stream structure
- Need to update test cases for:
  - Hierarchical path creation
  - Parent-child stream relationships
  - Path resolution behavior
  - Child stream listing in responses
  - CASCADE deletion of child streams

### Potential Future Enhancements

- Stream move/rename operations
- Breadcrumb navigation helpers
- Stream tree visualization
- Bulk operations on stream hierarchies

## Database Schema

Current hierarchical structure:

```sql
stream:
  id: bigint (primary key)
  pod_name: string
  name: string (no slashes)
  parent_id: bigint (references stream.id, CASCADE delete)

record:
  stream_id: bigint (references stream.id)
  name: string (no slashes)
```

This creates a proper tree structure where streams can be nested arbitrarily deep.
